		Principal Investigator(s):  Azam Chaudhry (Lahore School of Economics), 			Shamyla Chaudhary (Lahore School of Economics), Amit Khandelwal (Columbia 		University), Eric Verhoogen (Columbia University) & David Atkin (MIT)
		
			<ul  class="liststyle2" style="margin-left:1px;">
				<li>The study seeks to investigate the extent to which high costs of high-quality inputs 	are a barrier to upgrading in the soccer-ball sector. </li>
				<li>The team offered subsidies for high-quality rexine (i.e. artificial leather and one of the primary inputs into soccer-ball production) to a random subset of firms. Since fall of 2016, we have collected firm-level data regularly to examine if this subsidy spurs upgrading. </li>
				<li>The end-line survey is due to take place in the summer of 2018.</li>						
			</ul>
</li>
<br>
		<li><i>Barriers to Product Upgradation in the Sialkot Surgical Goods Sector:</i><br>
		Principal Investigator(s):  Azam Chaudhry (Lahore School of Economics), 			Shamyla Chaudhary (Lahore School of Economics), Amit Khandelwal (Columbia 		University), Eric Verhoogen (Columbia University) & David Atkin (MIT)
		
				<ul  class="liststyle2" style="margin-left:1px;">
					<li>The study investigates the extent to which fixed costs of innovation are a barrier to upgrading in the surgical-goods sector in Sialkot. </li>
					<li>The team aims to develop a randomized trial to incentivize firms to enter new product lines. We have developed a census of producers in the surgical goods sector in Sialkot using a short survey.  </li>
					<li>The team aims to launch the intervention by December 2018 and complete the follow up surveys by October 2020. </li>						
				</ul>
		</li>
		<br>
		<li><i>Developing an Optimal Industrial Strategy in the Context of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)</i><br>
		Theresa Chaudhry and Azam Chaudhry (Lahore School) are developing the elements of an optimal industrial strategy for Pakistan. With industrial growth and exports stagnating in Pakistan, there is an urgent need to develop a coordinated industrial strategy. The team working with Lahore School researchers and policy makers to develop an industrial strategy which has the following elements: (i) deciding on which sectors (and subsectors) to invest resources into, (ii) deciding the optimal location for planned industrial zones and special economic zones, (iii) determining the optimal location of industries in the context of CPEC, (iv) developing a coordinated trade strategy that helps promote higher value added exports and (v) determining the financing needs of the SMEs which make up most of the industrial clusters in Pakistan.
		
				
		</li><br>
		<li><i>Understanding Institutional Barriers to Technology Adoption in the Pakistani Manufacturing Sector </i><br>
		Matthew McCartney (University of Oxford), Theresa Chaudhry and Azam Chaudhry (Lahore School) plan to study the historical barriers to technology adoption in the Pakistani manufacturing sector with a special emphasis on institutional barriers like the conflict between workers and management, the impact of family run firms on organizational structures and the relationship between producers and suppliers in an uncertain business environment.
		</li>						
	</ol>


<br>

<ol start="2" style="margin-left:-45px;"><li>The Center will conduct 5 Business Confidence Surveys (one each year). It will keep on playing an active role in the dissemination of research by publishing articles in leading Urdu and English newspapers on monthly basis. </li>

<li>The Center will continue to get patents for the technologies, processes and products developed in the Lahore School of Economics.</li>

<li>The Center plans to build a theoretical model which jointly explains firms' location and technology choices. The objective of this research will be to determine the conditions under which different distributions of firms emerge across space and, more importantly, how firms' technology choices evolve over time. This research will also look at the role played by factor mobility in determining firms' location and technology choices.</li>
<li>The Center plans to collaborate with Mathew McCartney, Professor, School of Interdisciplinary Area Studies, University of Oxford, UK who will be coming to the Lahore School of Economics in Winter Term, 2018 on a sabbatical from the University of Oxford. The joint collaboration will work to develop joint research initiatives between the ITC and the University of Oxford.
