		<h3>Home country institutions and exports of firms: Does institution intensity matter?</h3><br>
			
			<p><b>Maryium Nazeef</b></p>
			
			<h3>Abstract</h3>	
		
		
	<p>Institutional quality is found in the literature as an important determinant of firm export performance, however this relationship is still controversial and highly constraint by the industry production. Based on these insights, the aim of the study is to investigate the institutional quality of the export performance of firms. Furthermore, the study will see the mediating effect of innovation at the extent by which the regulatory burden can perform a moderating effect. The data is collated from the World Bank's Enterprise Surveys of firms. The dataset will consist of South Asian economies including Pakistan (2013), India, Bangladesh (2013) and Sri Lanka (2011) (Total: 3299 firms).  Based on the sample of exporting companies operating in manufacturing industry, the study will estimate the determinants of export performance. The study is motivated by using the framework of "institution intensity/contract intensity" established by (Nunn, 2007). The results would give the insight of institution intensity framework, the role of which is aimed to propose the relevant policy implications. Though based on cross country analysis the study is specially motivated by the export performance of "institution intensity/contract intensity" framework for Pakistan economy.</p>
