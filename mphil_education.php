		<h3>Birth Order Effects on Child Labor</h3>
		<p><b>Researcher: </b>Maida Basharat (Ongoing)</p>
		
		<h5>Abstract</h5>
		
		<p>
		Birth order has impacted household resource allocation decisions in the past in terms of schooling, labor and nutrition. This paper attempts to study in-depth the impact birth order has on the schooling and child labor outcomes in a household. It also looks at how birth order might have a gender specific impact on these outcomes. For this purpose, the bivariate probit model is employed on the sample data given by Punjab MICS 2011. The results of this study imply that both first-born male and female children are more likely to work and latest-born male and female children are less likely to go to school. First born females are more likely to work in all types of work (market work + family work+ any positive hours worked domestically). First born males more likely to work in market and family work. A latest born male child is less likely to work in market and family work. First born female children are discriminated against in terms of domestic and all types of work which is indicative of our society. Latest Born male children are more likely to work in both market and family work and domestic work >20 hours and less likely to work otherwise. Latest born female children are less likely to work domestically (when even <20hrs per week considered) and in small families.

		<h3>Impact of Remoteness on Education Quality</h3>
		<p><b>Researcher: </b>Ringchan Ali (Ongoing)</p>
		
		<h5>Abstract</h5>
		
		<p>
		This paper explores the relationship between remoteness and the student learning outcomes and simultaneously investigates the impact of remoteness on school infrastructure. Existing literature focuses on the impact of remoteness on socio-economic conditions however, it lacks the idea of remoteness effecting education quality. Data related to the learning outcomes and school infrastructure has been acquired through Annual Status of Education Report (ASER 2016) dataset. This will be the first study to investigate the impact of remoteness on learning outcomes. Results of this study can help inform policy decisions to reduce educational inequities arising from remoteness in rural areas.

		<h3>The Impact of School Facilities on Drop outs in Pakistan</h3>
		<p><b>Researcher: </b>Mahniya Zafar (2018)</p>
		
		<h5>Abstract</h5>
		
		<p>
		The study explored the impact of attributes of school facilities on primary school dropouts in Pakistan. She used the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) data set from 2013, 2014 and 2015 to study the determinants of dropout at the primary level within a household, and the impact of school facilities (both public and private schools) on proportion of dropouts in a village. She also drew a statistical comparison of the impact of school facilities on primary and secondary level drop-outs. The author found that parent's education, asset ownership and gender have a significant impact on whether an individual drops out of school at the primary level. Further, the educational qualifications of private schools' teacher quality significantly reduce the proportion of dropouts in a village. However, once the student proceeds to the secondary level, the effect of household, school and teacher quality indicators diminishes. These results indicate the need for policy makers and educators to emphasize school and teacher quality to retain students in school.

		<h3>Impact of Female Secondary School Stipend Program on Enrollment, Marriage and Fertility Outcomes in Rural Punjab</h3>
		<p><b>Researcher: </b>Anam Masood (2015)</p>
		
		<h5>Abstract</h5>
		
		<p>
		We study the effects of Female Secondary School Stipend Program (FSSSP), a component of Punjab Education Sector Reform Program (PERSP) on school enrollment, middle and high school completion, marriage and fertility outcomes for eligible girls in rural areas of stipend recipient districts. The relevant control groups in this study include elder sisters and/or cousins in stipend districts, girls of similar age, their elder sisters and/or cousins in non-stipend districts. This paper uses triple difference-in-difference analyses to show the effects of program after ten years of implementation. Girls exposed to the program were more likely to remain in school if we look at a short (2003-2006) or medium (2003-2009) span of time, but were less likely to complete middle or high school. There is suggestive evidence that girls exposed to the program were engaged in early marriages and subsequently are younger at the birth of first child. These findings provide critical information for policy makers in assessing efficiency and effectiveness of such developmental programs.<br><br>

		<h3>Impact Of Child Labor On Schooling Outcome Of Children Living In Rural Punjab, Pakistan</h3>
		<p><b>Researcher: </b>Meera Shafqat (2014)</p>
		
		<h5>Abstract</h5>
		
		<p>
		This paper analyzes the relationship between child labour and schooling outcome, measured by grade-for-age, of children living in rural Punjab. The endogeneity between child labour and schooling was controlled by the use of instrumental variables. Using Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2007-2008, an inverted U-shaped relationship between the two was found, through the two stage least squares instrumental variable technique. The threshold level upto which a child can engage in labour without adversely affecting his studies was found out to be approximately 15 hours per week, implying that children living in rural Punjab can work for 15hours per week without it affecting their grade attainment. Moreover, mother's education level has a significant positive impact on a child's grade attainment. This impact is more pronounced for girls than boys. Children having younger siblings and additional school going siblings will suffer in terms of grade attainment due to the added responsibility placed on them by their household. The results also suggest that the children belonging to relatively wealthier households are less likely to lag behind in terms of grade attainment.

		<h3>Effects of External Migration on School Enrollments accumulated Schooling and Dropouts in Punjab</h3>
		<p><b>Researcher: </b>Rabia Arif (2011)</p>
		
		<h5>Abstract</h5>
		
		<p>
		Abstract In developing countries, external migration tends to ease household income constraints because of the external remittances that are generated. Using data on the Punjab, this working paper attempts to determine whether the external migration of individuals in a household has a positive effect on children's schooling outcomes as measured by school enrolments, the accumulated level of schooling, number of days spent in school, and dropouts. We use historic migration rates to instrument for migration in an analysis of school outcomes for children aged 5-17, 5- 11, and 12-17 to determine which group is most affected by external migration. The results show that external migration has a significantly positive impact on the school enrolments of younger children, whereas the accumulated level of schooling among older children increases significantly if there is an external migrant in their households.<br><br>
