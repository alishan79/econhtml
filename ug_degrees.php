		  	<h4>Undergraduate Study</h4>
			<p>
			Economics is concerned with the allocation of scarce resources and the distribution of income within and across societies. The B.Sc. (Hons.) Programs with Double Major in Economics and Finance/Management/Political Science/Accounting/Marketing and the Major in Economics and Minors in areas of Mathematics and Statistics, Social Sciences and Environmental Policy focus on understanding economic reasoning through the analysis of theoretical models and empirical evidence. This is combined with (as determined by the degree) thorough training in finance, management, mathematics, statistics and social sciences and environmental studies. Students have used this training for a wide range of career paths including graduate degrees and applied work in economic policy and business. The B.Sc.  Double Major Program in Economics and Marketing/Finance/Management/Political Science/Accounting covers requirements both for an Economics Bachelors (Hons.) degree and a Marketing/Finance/Management/Political Science/Accounting Bachelors (Hons.) degree and is designed to allow to students to pursue specialized further studies in both these disciplines.
