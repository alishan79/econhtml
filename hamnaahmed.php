1. Institutional capacity as an organizational challenge: a field experiment in Pakistan: (with Simon Quinn, Kate Vyborny and Asha Gul). This project involves a Randomized Control Trial (RCT) that aims to test whether community organizations can be incentivized to improve their performance through (i) Systematic self-assessment and reporting of defined key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and (ii) a transparent non-financial rewards scheme based on these KPIs. In addition, we study how each part of a large, complex organization (the donor) responds to new information on performance (of recipient organizations) on KPIs. Expected publications from this project: 
</p><br>
	<ul>
		<li>Study on RCT results (expected in 2020) </li>
		<li>Study based on a Regression Discontinuity Design: The aim of this study will be to test 	whether community organizations that support the winning politicians able to mobilize 	more resources and funding for their communities relative to organizations that were 	supporting the runner up politicians. (expected in 2020) </li>
		<li>Group decision making: evidence from a framed field experiment in rural Pakistan. The 	objective of this paper is to understand the process of collective decision-making within 	community development organizations in rural Pakistan. We investigate how individual 	preferences of members running community organizations aggregate into group 	preferences and we study the role of intrinsic characteristics in determining whether 	member's individual preferences are represented or ignored in-group preferences. 	(expected in 2019). </li>
		
	</ul>
	<br>
	
	
	
	<p>2. The impact of bundling health microinsurance with microcredit: Evidence from Punjab, Pakistan  </p><br>
	<ul>
		<li>(with Sadia Hussain and Naveed) A policy report that explores and analyses the main trends in utilization of the program since its inception (expected April 2018).</li>
		<li>(with Sadia Hussain) An academic paper that employs a Diff-in-Diff design to study the causal impact of bundling health microinsurance with microcredit on utilization of health facilities and client retention. (to be sent out to Geneva Papers on risk and insurance by June 2018). </li>
		
	</ul>

<br>

	<p>3. Rainfall Shocks and child health:  </p><br>
	<ul>
		<li>Rainfall Shocks and Children's Well-being in India (expected 2018) </li>
		<li>Rainfall Shocks and Child Health in Rural Pakistan (expected 2019) </li>
	</ul>
<br>


	<p>4. Overcoming constraints to giving (with Kate Vyborny and Sadia Hussain). In this study we propose a lab experiment to test  </p><br>
	<ul>
		<li>how potential donors respond to additional information; and </li>
		<li>whether their response to additional information varies if charitable giving is framed religiously or if giving decisions are made public. We study the impact of information on three aspects of donor behaviour: their perceptions about quality of recipient organizations, choice of organizations to donate to, and amount of donations. (expected in 2019) </li>
		
	</ul>

<br>

	<p>5. Overcoming constraints to female labor force entry (with Mahreen Mahmud, Farah Said and Zunia Tirmazee). We propose a randomised controlled trial to test the impact of two low-cost interventions to overcome psychological and information constraints to female labor force participation (FLFP). In particular, our research questions are, does (i) motivating female students and (ii) providing information about searching and applying for jobs, promote female labor force entry. We have recently received funding from PEDL for this study. (expected 2019) </p>
