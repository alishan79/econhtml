		<h3>Lahore School Scholar Visits Vienna to Present Research on Bureaucratic Identity</h3><br>

		<div align="center"><img src="images/Iden1.png" width="550px" ></div><br>		
		
		<p> Shaheen Naseer, Research and Teaching Fellow at the Centre for Research in Economics and Business (CREB) of the Lahore School of Economics presented her paper at 78th Annual conference of The Verein für Socialpolitik 2017: "Alternative Structures for Money and Banking" September 3rd - 6th, 2017 at the University of Vienna, Austria. <br><br>

At this conference, the core ideas underpinning the alternative architectures pertinent to money and banking were reviewed, and also their consistency, completeness, and prospects of adoption were assessed by leading and experienced representatives in the field: Michael Kumhof (Bank of England) and Albrecht Ritschl (London School of Economics).<br><br>

On this international stage, the author presented the work entitled "Bureaucratic Identity and the Shape of the Public Policy: A Game Theoretical Analysis". In this paper, the author developed a framework to understand the strategic interaction between the legislator and bureaucrats, building on the rational choice analysis of bureaucracies. The paper was very well received and the author received valuable comments on her work.
