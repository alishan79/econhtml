		<p>Maryiam Haroon a doctoral candidate and senior research fellow at the Centre for Research in Economics and Business, Lahore School of Economics participated in "The Place Dimension of Cities and Regions: Governance, Industrial Development and Sustainability", Annual Winter Conference 2017 hosted by Regional Studies Association (RSA) held on 16th and 17th November in London, UK. RSA works with international members to facilitate the highest standards of theoretical development, empirical analysis and policy debate of issues of sub-national scale, incorporating different conceptions of space, topics which align well with Maryiam's current research interest. The association arranges global-to-local series of conferences and events as a key forum in shaping and disseminating advances in regional studies. Maryiam presented her work titled "How close is close enough?  Geographical Proximity: Externalities versus Competition" coauthored with Dr. Azam Chaudhry in the session focusing on Place, Firm Location and Performance. She also chaired one of the sessions focusing on place leadership, governance and regional development. She benefited from engaging with vibrant mix of participants including policy makers, leading practitioners, student members and early career researchers.</p>
