			<h5>Work in Progress</h5><br>
			<ul>
				<li>Comparing Demand for Microcredit and Microsaving in a Framed Field Experiment in Rural Pakistan with Uzma Afzal, Marcel Fafchamps. Giovanna d'Adda and Simon Quinn.<br>
The study is a Randomized Control Trial designed to compare the effectiveness of micro-savings and micro-loans as means for households to manage risk and liquidity. This research is funded by the IGC and is conducted in collaboration with the National Rural Support Programme (NRSP), Pakistan. The research project has also received funding from Department for International Development (DfID) and Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) to carry out a scaled up version of the study that is currently in the field. Previously a pilot was conducted in one district of Punjab, Pakistan in August 2013.
</li>
				<li>Impact assessment of startup loans to female run micro-enterprises with Azam Chaudhry, Giovanna d'Adda, Naved Hamid and Mahreen Mahmud.<br>
This study is an impact evaluation of a unique micro-loan product with a training component that is provided only to female borrowers to start-up their microenterprise. The research is a collaboration between the Lahore School of Economics and the Kashf Foundation, Pakistan. Baseline activities were funded by the Kashf Foundation and were concluded in August 2014. Endline activities are being funded by the International Growth Centre (IGC).
</li>
				<li>Pressures from peers and spouses and self-control problems as constraints to microenterprise growth: Experimental evidence from Pakistan with with Uzma Afzal, Marcel Fafchamps and Giovanna d'Adda.<br>
This study will assess the role of self-control problems and peer pressures on take-up and use of a financial product by female micro-entrepreneurs in Pakistan, by combining laboratory and field experiments. This project is funded by the IGC. Pilots for this study were conducted in April, 2015.
</li>
				<li>Access to solar electricity in rural Sindh: Role of payment schedule and planning with Jacopo Bonan, Giovanna d'Adda, Mahreen Mahmud and Massimo Tavoni.<br>
This research is funded by the IGC and will be conducted in collaboration with Eco Energy Finance (EEF). EEF provides solar energy solutions to customers in o_-grid areas under a pay-as-you-go monthly repayment scheme. This field experiment will use behavioral measures to investigate individual constraints to repayment and the sustainability of this business model.
</li>
				<li>Constraints to Female Entrepreneurship in Pakistan: the role of womens goals and aspirations with Giovanna d'Adda, Mahreen Mahmud and Diego Ubfal.<br>
This study involves a RCT and behavioural experiments in Punjab, Pakistan to test the role that psychological and social factors have in limiting female autonomous decision making and control over resources. The interventions will be focused changing aspirations, motivation and self-confidence and on setting goals and making plans for business investment as a soft commitment mechanism that can help address self-control problems.
</li>
				<li>Behavioural insights for evidence-based policy making - impact of depression intervention on individual preferences with Sonia Balhotra and Utteeyo Dasgupta.<br>
This research aims to use lab-in-the-field experiments to identify behavioural effects of depression on women. Among preferences that we expect are modified by depression or violence exposure are the valuation of agency, present-biasedness, risk-aversion and confidence.
</li>
				<li>Breaking the cycle. Reducing non-payment for electricity: experimental evidence from Pakistan with Jacopo Bonan, Giovanna d'Adda, Mahreen Mahmud and Massimo Tavoni.<br>
This research is funded by the IGC and will be conducted in collaboration with Karachi Electric (KE). Energy provision by KE follows a policy of selective load shedding at the neighborhood level, with the number of hours of outages increasing in the level of losses. Under this policy, the individual decision to pay in full is, therefore, also that of contributing to a local public good. This research will test the effectiveness of behavioral interventions in fostering regular bill payment through a randomised field experiment (RCT) to be conducted in Karachi, Pakistan.
